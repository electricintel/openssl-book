Acting as a certificate authority (CA) means dealing with cryptographic pairs of private keys and public certificates. The very first cryptographic pair weâ€™ll create is the root pair. This consists of the root key (ca.key.pem) and root certificate (ca.cert.pem). This pair forms the identity of your CA.

Choosing directory /root/ca to store all keys and certificates.
